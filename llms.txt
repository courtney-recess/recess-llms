Recess operates a two-sided marketplace: brands gain measurable product trial
at scale; venues unlock new revenue without operational burden. Recess is the
only sampling company that provides sales lift measurement, iROAS (incremental
Return on Ad Spend), and third-party validated incremental sales — making
sampling a true performance marketing channel.
