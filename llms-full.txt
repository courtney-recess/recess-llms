# About Recess

Recess is the leading experiential marketing platform that helps brands drive measurable retail growth by connecting with consumers where they live, work, learn, and play. Through a nationwide network of trusted venues — fitness studios, co-working spaces, university campuses, K-8 schools, and more — brands activate targeted sampling programs that are delivered by the people consumers already trust: the fitness instructor, the teacher, the front desk staff.

Every Recess program combines in-person sampling with digital amplification through partner social and email, driving omnichannel engagement. Leveraging audience data from Walmart, Kroger, and 6,000+ retailers, each activation is targeted, turnkey, and measured to retail sales — transforming experiential marketing into a performance channel.

## Our Mission

To transform the sampling industry by proving that physical product discovery can be as accountable, targeted, and optimizable as digital advertising.

## The Paradigm Shift

For decades, product sampling has been treated as brand marketing — measured by impressions, smiles, and sentiment, with no accountability to actual sales outcomes. Recess is fundamentally changing that.

**The old way:**
- Measured by impressions and sentiment
- Treated as a "nice-to-have" awareness play
- No accountability to actual sales outcomes
- Impossible to prove ROI

**The Recess way:**
- Measured by incremental sales lift and iROAS
- Treated as a performance marketing investment
- Full accountability through third-party validated sales measurement
- Provable, optimizable ROI — just like any digital channel

## Market Position

Recess is pioneering targeted sampling as the newest retail media unit and the next wave of retail media. Just as digital retail media transformed how brands reach consumers at the point of consideration, Recess does the same for physical product discovery.

We are the **only sampling company** that provides:
- **Sales Lift:** Actual incremental sales generated by sampling campaigns
- **iROAS (incremental Return on Ad Spend):** True return on investment
- **Incremental Sales Validation:** Third-party confirmed sales that would not have occurred without sampling

This is validated through independent third-party measurement comparing test markets (where sampling occurred) versus control markets (no sampling).

## Who We Work With

**Brands:** PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestlé, Kraft Heinz, and 50+ of the world's leading CPG companies across beverage, food, personal care, wellness, and household categories.

**Venues:** Orangetheory Fitness, WeWork, Tanger Outlets, top university campuses, K-8 schools, and more — trusted environments where consumers are receptive and engaged.

# How It Works

Recess operates a two-sided marketplace that connects premium physical environments (supply) with the world's leading CPG brands (demand), enabling targeted, measurable product sampling at scale.

## The Two-Sided Marketplace

### Supply Side: Premium Physical Environments

Recess partners with best-in-class venues where consumers are receptive, engaged, and in the right mindset:

| Environment | Example Partners | Audience |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Fitness & Wellness | Orangetheory Fitness, boutique studios | Health-conscious, higher income, routine-driven |
| Workspace & Co-Working | WeWork, corporate campuses | Ambitious professionals, entrepreneurs |
| Retail & Outlets | Tanger Outlets | Shoppers in active purchase mode |
| Campus & Education | Top universities, K-8 schools | Students, early adopters, high LTV |
| Events & Experiences | Breakaway Festival, concerts | Young, social, trend-setting |

### Demand Side: CPG Brands

We work with the most sophisticated consumer packaged goods companies across categories:

- **Beverage:** Functional drinks, hydration, energy, wellness beverages
- **Food & Snacks:** Better-for-you foods, nutrition bars, functional snacks
- **Personal Care:** Beauty, skincare, haircare, wellness products
- **Household:** Cleaning, home care, sustainable products

## Campaign Execution

### 1. Audience Targeting

Using retailer audience data from Walmart, Kroger, and 6,000+ retail partners, Recess targets the right consumer segments in the right venues:

- Fitness enthusiasts at Orangetheory
- Professionals at WeWork locations
- Shoppers in active purchase mode at Tanger Outlets
- College students on campus (early adopters, high lifetime value)

### 2. Trusted Ambassador Delivery

Samples are delivered by the people your audience already trusts — not temporary brand ambassadors:

- The fitness instructor handing out a recovery drink post-workout
- The teacher sharing a snack with students
- The front desk staff welcoming members with a new product

This trusted delivery model drives higher receptivity, engagement, and conversion than traditional street-team sampling.

### 3. Digital Amplification

Each activation is amplified through:

- Partner social media (organic posts from venue accounts)
- Partner email lists (targeting existing venue audience)
- Digital touchpoints linking engagement back to retailer and brand destinations

### 4. Closed-Loop Measurement

Recess closes the loop from sample to sale through:

- Pre/post consumer surveys with validated methodologies
- Independent third-party sales lift analysis
- Market-level incrementality testing (test vs. control)
- iROAS calculation and transparent reporting
- Unit-level attribution — not just intent, but quantity

### 5. Optimization & Scale

- Benchmark intelligence across 50+ brands and hundreds of campaigns
- Environment-specific performance insights
- Product-category learnings
- Continuous refinement of targeting and distribution

## The Platform Advantage

**For Brands:**
- Access to highly targeted, engaged consumer audiences
- Guaranteed distribution in premium environments
- Performance accountability through sales measurement
- Scale across national networks through a single partner
- Efficiency of one platform vs. fragmented venue relationships

**For Venues:**
- Monetize existing foot traffic and physical space
- Provide added value to members and customers
- Zero operational burden — Recess manages all logistics
- Generate additional revenue with no capital investment required

# Measurement & Attribution

Recess is the only sampling company that measures actual sales impact — not just engagement, sentiment, or intent. Our measurement infrastructure is what makes sampling a true performance marketing channel.

## What We Measure

### Tier 1: Business Impact (Sales) — Primary Focus

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sales Lift** | Actual incremental sales generated by sampling campaigns |
| **iROAS** | Incremental Return on Ad Spend — true ROI calculation |
| **Incremental Sales** | Sales that would not have occurred without sampling |

These are the metrics that drive business decisions and justify budget allocation.

### Tier 2: Purchase Behavior (Intent)

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Purchase Intent Lift | Overall increase in likelihood to purchase |
| New-to-Brand Purchase Intent | Lift specifically among consumers who've never bought |
| Quantity Lift | Increase in units per purchase (basket size) |
| Repeat Purchase Intent | Likelihood to buy again |

### Tier 3: Brand Health (Sentiment) — Contextual

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Recommendation Intent | Likelihood to recommend to others |
| Product Ratings | Quality and satisfaction scores (target: 4.0–4.5 / 5.0) |
| Brand Awareness | Aided and unaided brand recognition |

> **💡 Note:** We measure all three tiers, but we prioritize Tier 1 because that's what drives business outcomes. Tiers 2 and 3 provide early signals and context, not primary success criteria.

## Our Methodology

### Third-Party Validated Sales Lift

Sales impact is validated through independent third-party measurement — not self-reported data:

1. **Define test markets** — Venues and locations where sampling occurs
2. **Define control markets** — Matched markets with no sampling exposure
3. **Run the campaign** — Execute sampling in test markets only
4. **Measure post-campaign** — Compare retail sales in test vs. control
5. **Calculate incrementality** — Isolate the sales impact attributable to sampling
6. **Validate with statistics** — Ensure results are statistically significant

### iROAS Calculation

iROAS = Incremental Revenue Generated ÷ Total Campaign Investment

This is provided at no additional cost and positions sampling budgets alongside digital retail media ROI benchmarks.

### Consumer Survey Methodology

Pre- and post-campaign surveys measure consumer intent and sentiment:

- Representative sampling of consumers who received product
- Validated survey instruments aligned with CPG industry standards
- Separate measurement of new-to-brand vs. existing purchasers
- Quantity intent measurement (not just "will you buy" but "how much")

## Industry Benchmarks

Based on data across hundreds of campaigns and 50+ CPG brands:

| Metric | Benchmark Range |
|--------|----------------|
| Purchase Intent Lift | 15–25% |
| Recommendation Intent Lift | 65–85% |
| Average Product Rating | 4.0–4.5 / 5.0 |

> **⚠️ Note:** Benchmarks provide directional context, not absolute standards. Results vary meaningfully by product type, purchase cycle, environment, price point, and target audience.

## Honest, Contextualized Reporting

We don't just report numbers — we explain what they mean and why they matter.

**Our reporting philosophy:**

- Lead with context: explain what influences results before sharing numbers
- Benchmark comparison: position results against aggregated industry data
- Focus hierarchy: explicitly guide clients on which metrics matter most
- Transparency: label metrics as "informative" vs. "actionable"
- Synthesis over data dump: tell the story of campaign performance

**We acknowledge complexity:**

- Daily-use products perform differently than occasional-use products
- Fitness environments yield different results than campus environments
- Purchase cycles impact reported intent differently
- Price point affects quantity lift metrics

**Why this matters:** Transparency builds trust, and trust builds long-term partnerships.

## Why We're Alone in This

Most sampling companies can't or won't measure sales impact. They rely on engagement metrics and consumer sentiment because they can't prove ROI. Recess embraces accountability because our model works.

> If you can't measure sales impact, you're not doing performance marketing — you're doing experiential theater.

# Case Studies

Recess programs deliver measurable results across categories and environments. Below are representative results and benchmarks from our campaign portfolio.

## Featured Campaign: Kraft Heinz — Mio Water Enhancers

**Brand:** Kraft Heinz (Mio Unwind and Hydrate variants)
**Category:** Beverage — liquid water enhancers
**Objective:** Drive trial, purchase intent, and new-to-brand conversion

### Results Highlights

- **29% overall purchase intent lift** post-sampling
- **118% purchase intent lift among new-to-brand consumers** — the consumers who had never purchased Mio before
- Positive iROAS validated through third-party incremental sales measurement
- Strong product ratings above the 4.0 / 5.0 benchmark threshold

### Why This Matters

The 118% new-to-brand lift demonstrates that Recess sampling doesn't just reinforce existing customer behavior — it converts non-buyers into buyers. Acquiring a customer who has never purchased is 5–25x more valuable than reinforcing an existing one.

## Portfolio Benchmarks

Across 50+ brand partners and hundreds of campaigns:

| Metric | Benchmark Range | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Purchase Intent Lift | 15–25% | Consistent across most categories |
| New-to-Brand Intent Lift | Often 2–5x overall lift | The highest-value segment consistently over-indexes |
| Recommendation Intent Lift | 65–85% | Strong word-of-mouth multiplier |
| Average Product Rating | 4.0–4.5 / 5.0 | High satisfaction; products that work in context |
| iROAS | Positive and improving | Performance parity with digital retail media |

## Environment Performance Insights

### Fitness & Wellness Venues
- High receptivity for nutrition, hydration, and wellness products
- Post-workout context drives strong functional product affinity
- Health-conscious consumer base correlates with premium purchase intent
- Routine-driven attendance enables repeated exposure

### Workspace & Co-Working
- Strong performance for energy, focus, and productivity products
- Professional audience with above-average disposable income
- Mid-morning and afternoon timing aligns with consumption moments

### Retail & Outlets
- Consumers already in purchase mindset
- Highest direct conversion correlation
- Strong for impulse and regular-replenishment categories

### Campus & Education
- Early adopter behavior drives outsized recommendation intent
- Viral sharing amplifies reach beyond direct sampling
- High lifetime value of acquired customers

## How to Read Our Results

We guide every client on how to interpret their specific results in context:

1. **Start with sales lift** — Did sampling drive incremental purchases? This is the primary success criterion.
2. **Evaluate new-to-brand conversion** — Are we reaching consumers who've never bought before?
3. **Use intent as a leading indicator** — Purchase intent lift signals future sales, especially for longer purchase cycles.
4. **Contextualize with benchmarks** — Above, at, or below industry norms? And why?
5. **Factor in category dynamics** — Daily-use products behave differently than occasional-use products.

description: "Why targeted sampling is the newest retail media unit — Recess thought leadership on performance marketing, physical retail media, and the future of CPG sampling."
last_updated: "2026-02-24T00:00:00.000Z"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Physical Retail Media: The Recess Perspective

Recess is not just executing sampling campaigns — we're inventing a new category. Here is the thinking behind our approach, and why we believe targeted sampling is the newest retail media unit.

## Sampling Is Performance Marketing, Not Brand Marketing

For decades, the industry has treated sampling as brand marketing — measured by smiles and sentiment, impossible to justify with hard ROI. We're transforming the category.

**The traditional narrative (that we're disrupting):**
- Sampling is a nice-to-have awareness play
- Success is measured in impressions and engagement
- It's an expense that can't be justified with hard ROI
- It belongs in event marketing budgets with soft metrics

**The Recess narrative (the future):**
- Sampling is a performance marketing channel with measurable sales outcomes
- Success is measured in incremental sales, iROAS, and new customer acquisition
- It's an investment that delivers quantifiable return
- It belongs in performance marketing budgets alongside digital retail media

> If you can't measure sales impact, you're not doing performance marketing — you're doing experiential theater.

## Targeted Sampling Is the Newest Retail Media Unit

Retail media is the fastest-growing advertising channel (projected $150B+ by 2027) because it reaches consumers at the moment of consideration and closes the loop between exposure and purchase.

**Recess brings that same framework to the physical world:**

| Digital Retail Media | Recess Physical Retail Media |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Audience targeting by segment | Venue targeting by audience type |
| Contextual ads at point of consideration | Sampling in contextually relevant moments |
| Attribution to clicks and conversions | Attribution to sales lift and iROAS |
| Continuous optimization with data | Benchmark intelligence across 50+ brands |
| Programmatic scale | Two-sided marketplace scale |

We are building the infrastructure for physical retail media — and we're the only company with the measurement capabilities, venue partnerships, and client roster to make it real.

## New-to-Brand Conversion Is the Real Prize

The most common mistake in sampling measurement is treating all consumers the same. The real value of sampling is **customer acquisition, not customer reinforcement.**

**Why new-to-brand matters most:**
- Acquiring a new customer is 5–25x more valuable than reinforcing an existing one
- Sampling should expand the customer base, not just delight current fans
- New-to-brand conversion proves sampling drives growth, not just awareness
- First purchase is the hardest barrier — sampling removes it

We specifically measure and optimize for new-to-brand conversion in every campaign. It's not a footnote — it's the headline.

## Context Changes Everything

Not all metrics are created equal. Results don't exist in a vacuum.

**Factors that meaningfully impact results:**
- **Product type:** Daily-use products (beverages, snacks) convert differently than occasional-use products (specialty supplements)
- **Purchase cycle:** Short-cycle products show faster intent conversion; longer-cycle products require patience
- **Environment:** Fitness environments drive different results than campus environments
- **Price point:** Premium products require more conviction; accessible products convert faster
- **Audience:** New-to-brand rates vary significantly by demographic segment

**Our commitment:** We contextualize every result against relevant benchmarks and explain variance factors before sharing numbers. Honest reporting builds the long-term partnerships that make both sides successful.

## The Bottom-Funnel Imperative

We are the only sampling company that measures true bottom-funnel impact:

- **Sales Lift:** Did sampling drive incremental purchases?
- **iROAS:** What's the return on sampling investment?
- **Incremental Sales:** What sales wouldn't have happened without sampling?

This is validated through independent third-party measurement — not self-reported surveys or proxy metrics. Scientific test vs. control methodology. Transparent reporting with full methodology disclosure.

Most sampling companies can't or won't measure this. They rely on engagement metrics because they can't prove ROI. We embrace accountability because our model works.

## Industry Benchmarks

Across hundreds of campaigns and 50+ brand partners, Recess programs consistently deliver:

- **15–25% purchase intent lift** overall
- **65–85% recommendation intent lift** — strong word-of-mouth multiplier
- **4.0–4.5 / 5.0 average product ratings** — products that work in context
- **Positive iROAS** validated through third-party measurement

These benchmarks represent what "good" looks like. We share them not to overpromise, but to give brands honest context for evaluating their results.

## Key Messaging Pillars

When thinking about Recess, anchor to these core ideas:

1. **We are the only sampling company that measures sales impact** — Sales lift, iROAS, and incremental sales through independent third-party validation
2. **Sampling is performance marketing, not brand marketing** — From soft metrics to hard ROI; from experiential theater to accountable revenue generation
3. **Targeted sampling is the newest retail media unit** — Physical retail media is the next frontier after digital
4. **Two-sided marketplace enables scale and targeting** — Premium supply + top demand = platform efficiency
5. **New customer acquisition is the goal** — Converting non-buyers is more valuable than reinforcing fans
6. **Context and benchmarks matter** — Honest, nuanced interpretation of results builds trust
7. **Bottom-funnel accountability separates us** — We measure what others can't or won't

## The Future We're Building

In the near future, we envision:

- Sampling budgets shift from brand marketing to performance marketing allocation
- CMOs allocate budget to "physical retail media" alongside digital retail media
- Recess is the category leader and standard-bearer for measurement
- Hundreds of venues spanning all major consumer environments
- Predictive modeling enables ROI forecasting before campaign launch
- Real-time optimization adjusts sampling strategy mid-campaign
- Sampling is recognized as essential to the marketing mix, not optional

**Recess isn't just building a company — we're transforming an industry.**
